## About Me/Background

My name is Adam Chhibbane, I am 31 years, and a California native. My educational background is in the humanities (UCB, BA in Classical Languages), and my professional background is in hospitality, namely working as a Sommelier in fine dining --and therefore, a complete novice to programmming and finance.

### Career Goals

Though I am quite open to explore numerous career opportunities, especially since I have no formal training, and therefore, do not know what my strengths are as of yet, that said, my career goal would be to work in a field that intersects fintech and more traditional finance related jobs, especially involving either trading or financial analysis --and this course, I imagine, involves the first of many steps towards that goal.

#### Why Fintech?

Over the past two years, I have gained a focused --though certainly amateur-- interest in financial markets, macro economics, trading. Wanting to switch careers, I have also realized that the greater financial industry seems ripe for change with the increased advance of information technologies into the space, and entre into finance as a career may be easier with a grounding in programming knowledge, in particular python.
